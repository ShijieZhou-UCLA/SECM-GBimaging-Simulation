# SECM imaging with additional nuisances signals (Garbage Bin)
---
## 1. Algorithm
Please find out the detail in `APG for Garbage Bin.pdf`
## 2. Data
We use synthetic data for this simulation experiment. The ground truth for structured signal (triangles) will be randomly generated through the code.

* `e_2d.mat`- nuisances signals (blob image)

## 3. Use of Code
Please the following code directly:

* `PGGB.m`- proximal gradient method
* `APGGB.m`- accelerated proximal gradient method
